# CCT-town-employee-pay-23
This is the repository of raw data used in the Cape Cod Times' 2023 story on town employee earnings. The spreadsheets included here contain data obtained by public records requests made to the 15 towns of Cape Cod.

Each town's spreadsheet can be clicked on to view the top 50 highest earners in the town government. Other information such as base salary and overtime earnings are also included.

Notes: 

Falmouth's data includes both the top 50 school employees and the top 50 town employees. An additional column is included in the Falmouth spreadsheet to denote which employees belong to which half. To isolate the town or the school, simply search for "TOWN" or "SCHOOL" in the search bar.

Provincetown was unable to fulfill the Times' public records request immediately, saying that their payroll system does not differentiate between salary and overtime payments. They are working on the request and their data will be added to this repository when provided.

This repository is not editable to ensure it is preserved for all readers to browse. You may download copies of the individual .csv files to manipulate the data.
